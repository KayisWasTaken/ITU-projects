# Group 1.4: Statistical Analysis of Bird Extinction Factors

This repository contains the research project "Statistical Analysis of Bird Extinction Factors," conducted by:
- Cristina Avram
- Shanon Marietta Badger
- Gabriela Zhelyazkova
- Daniil Strelan
- Alexis Serruys.

The project, completed on March 18, 2023, explores the relationship between various factors and the extinction times of bird populations around Britain. Utilizing a dataset of breeding pairs of land-bird species collected from 16 islands, this investigation employs statistical methods to understand how factors like nesting pairs, size, and migratory status influence extinction.

## Repository Contents

- `Group1.4_Report.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, data analysis, and conclusions of the study.
- `Analysis_Code.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing all the R code used for data analysis, model fitting, and generation of plots.

## Project Overview

The project aims to statistically investigate factors affecting bird extinction, motivated by the need to understand and potentially mitigate the declining bird populations. Through rigorous data analysis, transformations, and model fitting using R, the team identifies significant predictors of extinction times and develops a predictive model.

## Key Findings

- Nesting pairs, size, and migratory status significantly affect bird extinction times.
- Logarithmic transformation of extinction times provided the best model fit.
- A reduced model suggests that with the number of breeding pairs, size, and migratory status, one can predict a bird species' extinction period.

## Usage

To replicate our analysis or explore the data further:
1. Ensure you have R and RStudio installed.
2. Open `Analysis_Code.Rmd` in RStudio.
3. Install required packages listed at the beginning of the Rmd file.
4. Run the code chunks sequentially to generate the analysis and plots.
