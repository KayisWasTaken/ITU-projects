# Project 2: Medical Imaging

## Overview
This project, conducted by Group 2 of the BSc in Data Science at the IT University of Copenhagen, explores the feasibility of utilizing image analysis algorithms for the reliable measurement of specific features in skin lesions. Our research focuses on the development of machine learning models capable of classifying skin lesions as benign or malignant, aiming to enhance early skin cancer detection.

## Background
Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer, with a high diagnosis rate in the U.S. Early detection through visual examination and imaging is critical for improving survival rates. This project aims to advance automated detection methods for cancerous skin lesions, potentially increasing early detection rates.

## Research Objectives
- To evaluate the performance of machine learning models on the diagnosis of unseen skin lesion images.
- To develop algorithms capable of extracting relevant features from skin lesion images.
- To assess the impact of image quality on model performance and prediction accuracy.

## Methodology
Our approach includes data exploration and preprocessing, manual and automatic feature extraction, algorithm design, and classifier training and evaluation. We applied various machine learning models to classify skin lesions based on features aligned with the 7-point checklist method.

## Results
We achieved varying levels of success with different classifiers, highlighting the importance of image quality and the challenges of overfitting. Our findings suggest that further research is needed to optimize model performance and generalizeability.

## Discussion
The project underscores the potential and limitations of using automated systems for skin cancer detection. Future work will focus on improving model robustness, exploring the impact of image quality more thoroughly, and expanding the dataset for training and testing.

## Conclusion
Our study contributes to the ongoing research into automated skin lesion classification, offering insights that could lead to improved diagnostic capabilities for skin cancer detection.
