# ITU Data Science Projects

Welcome to my collection of data science projects completed during my course at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU). Each project in this repository showcases a different application of data science and machine learning techniques.

## Projects Overview

- **A Statistical Analysis of Bird Extinction Factors**: An in-depth analysis focusing on the factors contributing to bird species' extinction risks using statistical models.
  
- **Machine Learning - Clothing Classification**: A project leveraging machine learning to classify items of clothing from image data.
  
- **Medical Imaging - Skin Lesion Detection**: An application of image processing and machine learning algorithms to detect and classify skin lesions.

## Repository Structure

Each project is contained within its own directory and includes:

- A detailed `README.md` file explaining the project's aim, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- Source code in Jupyter Notebooks or R Markdown files, demonstrating the analysis and modeling process.
- A `data` directory (where applicable), containing the datasets used in the project.
- An `assets` or `images` directory (where applicable), containing any images or additional resources referenced in the project.
- A `report.pdf` extensive report explaining the project's inception, development process, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and overall outcomes, providing comprehensive insights into the project's scope, objectives, and achievements.

## Technologies Used

This collection of projects utilizes a variety of data science tools and technologies, including:

- R and RStudio for statistical analysis and data visualization.
- Python and Jupyter Notebooks for machine learning and image processing.
- Libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras for data manipulation and modeling.
- Git for version control.

## How to Navigate

To explore a project, simply navigate to the corresponding directory. Each project is self-contained and includes instructions on how to set up the environment, run the code, and interpret the results or read the extensive reports.

These projects were part of the coursework for the BSc in Data Science at the IT University of Copenhagen. They represent a snapshot of my learning journey and my commitment to applying data science to solve diverse problems.
